<h1> Fortnite
 <h1/>
  <h2> Description: 
  </h2> Fortnite is a third person battle royale shooter game. There are 100 people each game and the goal is to live the longest and survive to the end. You will drop at a certain location to find loot and other items to help you survive. One big aspect of the game is a feature called building. by harvesting materials you can switch into build mode to build walls, floors, ramps and roofs. these four options can be used to provide cover and protection from other players. Another large aspect of the game is the storm. At the start of the game the whole map will be available to play but as the game goes on the storm will slowly close in forcing players to have to run into each other. The game is over when one person wins by being the last one alive in the match. after that they will be sent back to the lobby to go for another game.
