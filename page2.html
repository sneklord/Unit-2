 <h1> Should music be downloaded illegaly?
 <h1/>
  <p> My Point of view
  Downloading music illegaly can be very helpful to most people. But there are also risks that come with it. Overall taking information from both sides i think the answer i have come to is that no. Music shouldn't be downloaded illegaly. This is because there are many free services that let you stream music for free and safely. This is my look on the whole sittuation.
