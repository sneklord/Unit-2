  <p> Conclusion:
  In conlclusion this is a topic that is contriversal in our world today and even though it might not seem like a huge issue it definetly needs to be discussed. Here I just barely scratched the surface on this and there is so much more to be talked about. Anyways the point is that an answer needs to be found so this problem can be put to rest.
